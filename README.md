# Psychic-Reader
This is a single page application built with Angular 1 and uses Firebase to store data. You can create a user is the registration field. Then login and see what information the psychic reader has retrieved from your soul.

Note: the dependencies have been committed since this app is being hosted on paperplane.io right from github.
